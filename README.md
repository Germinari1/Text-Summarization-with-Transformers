# Text Summarization with Transformers
This notebook explores text summarization with transformer models. It covers data gathering and preprocessing, model building, generation of output text, and handy explanations along the way.
Also, those more familiar with ML and NLP will notice that many things in this notebook seem unnecessarily implemented "from scratch" (or not as abstracted as possible). In a production code, this approach would not be recommended in general, but this notebook is more focused on exploring the concepts and experimenting with the code :)

## Quick Start
To run the project, you can clone this repository:
```txt
git clone https://github.com/Germinari1/Text-Summarization-with-Transformers.git
```
or manually download the repository.
Then, you can open the notebook and run each cell as you wish. Additionally, you can make sure that all dependencies are installed by running:
```txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
